4. Functionality: This shows the basic functionality of the prototype.


## Types of Wireframes
1. Low fidelity wireframe: With this kind of wireframe, it does not contain detailed design and that is not the final design for development phase.
2. High fidelity wireframe: With this kind of wireframe, it contains a detailed design of the prototype and is usually the final design for development phase.

## Popular Wireframing Tools
1. Figma
2. Miro
3. Adobe XD
4. Sketch

## Benefits of wireframing
1. To clarify ideas
2. To aid in development phase
